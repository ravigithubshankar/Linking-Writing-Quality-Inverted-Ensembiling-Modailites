## Keystroke-Based Writing Quality Prediction
### Description

This project aims to predict overall writing quality by analyzing keystroke logs that capture detailed writing process features. The goal is to explore how typing behavior affects essay outcomes and to provide insights for writing instruction, automated evaluation systems, and intelligent tutoring systems.

The project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition, where we achieved a top 100 position with a public score of 0.5718 and a private score of 0.5761.

### Competition Context

The competition dataset includes large-scale keystroke logs, representing learners' writing behaviors and essay outcomes. The challenge was to build a model capable of accurately predicting writing quality based on these features, offering valuable insights into how typing patterns influence essay performance.
